# Section 1: Python + Machine Learning (1.5 hours)
Tasks:
* Load the dataset and perform data cleaning.
* Perform EDA using visualizations (use seaborn, matplotlib).
* Predict whether a student will pass or fail based on scores and other features.
* Use Logistic Regression or Random Forest for classification.
* Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, F1-score.
* Add comments/markdown to explain the steps.
